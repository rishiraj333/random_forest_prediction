# random_forest_prediction_model
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a Random Forest prediction model.
It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to predict the target variable effectively.

Included:

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  
- Feature Engineering & Selection
  
- Random Forest Model Implementation
  
- Model Evaluation & Performance Metrics
  
- Easy-to-Use Jupyter Notebook

**Random Forest** is a machine learning model that makes predictions by combining the opinions of many decision trees.
More Reliable – Instead of relying on a single model (which might be biased or wrong), it combines multiple models to improve accuracy.
Handles Complex Data – Works well even if the data has missing values or many influencing factors.
Prevents Overfitting – Unlike a single decision tree that may be too specific, Random Forest balances accuracy and generalisation.
